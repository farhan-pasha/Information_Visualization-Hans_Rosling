# Information_Visualization-Hans_Rosling

My visualization contains following Key features.

**1.** A Bubble plot representing countries in the World Economic Forum Global Competitive Report.

```
1.1 Where the area of the bubble represents the population of the country.
```
```
1 .2 The X-axis defines the GDP on the logarithmic scale of 0 to 100,000.
```
```
1.3 The Y-axis defines the Global Competitive index ranging 0 to 6.
```
**2.** As the visualization is highly interactive I made on-hover Labels for the particular data point, for example, when I
hover above a specific country in the bubble chart, it shows the name for the particular bubble and the population
associated with it. Ikept the background for the visualization as “white colored background” so that the background
color doesn’t match with any country’s color and also to avoid distraction of audience. The color for country are
assigned in such a way that no two country will have same color so that I can easily distinguish between countries.

**3**. The Bubble Plot here is an animated chart, when the play button is pressed, the data automatically gets updated for
that particular year. Until pause button is pressed, the year-wise data gets updated automatically from the year 2007 to
2017 and repeats.

**4.** If paused, it shows the data (GDP, Global_Competitive_Index, Population) related to that particular year.

**5**. Our Visualization has 3 drop-down menus which allows you to select.

**5**. **1. First Country** – When Country is selected it will show:

**5.1.1. On the left hand side –** It shows the data for particular year and particular country.

```
5.1.2. On the right hand side – It shows 12 pillars from GCI dataset in the form of bar chart. When
dealing with the categorical data the bar plots are one of the most effective ways to do the visualization,
that’s what I have shown in the first chart of selecting one country. In this I have to select the
country from the drop down - which will show the bar plot for 12 pillars of the selected country.
```
**5.2. Second Country –** When the second country is selected (along with First country):

**5.2.1. On the left hand side –** It shows the data of both the country.

```
5.2.2. On the right hand side – It shows comparative analysis of 12 pillars for 2 selected
countries in the form of Scatter Plot. For the second chart I have to do the comparison between two
countries for 12 pillars, if I do it with the bar plots then 24 pillars for 2 countries would an ineffective
visualization therefore I have selected the scatter plot to show the comparison of 2 countries.
```
```
5.3. Trail – When the country is selected from this dropdown menu, it shows the journey of the Country
selected over the year. I have adjusted the Y-Axis so that the journey covered by the country can be viewed
clearly. I also show faded transparency as the year passes by to convey the differences between the years at a
glance.
